Your company has been asked to installed several elevators in the lobby of stanson head quarters. Since they are moving offices within the next 2 years they would like to have the program be reusable in the next building as well.

#Goal
Javascript: Develop a UI that shows the "request buttons" for each floor that is in the building, and the inside console used to control the elevator.

#Requirements
* There needs to always be one elevator on the 1st floor for new arrivals, when somebody gets in the elevator on the first floor make sure the closest elevator will either go or return to the first floor
* The buttons to request an elevator in the hallways, and to select a floor, need to light up with the floors that are requested
* The closest elevator to the current requester should go to honor the request.
* Inside the elevator it should always display the current floor the elevator is on
* Inside the elevator it should display the direction the elevator is moving in.
* Add a travel time to the elevator
* Write some tests to make sure everything is working as expected (faux tests are fine)

#Bonus
* Implement not one "request" button but "up/down request" buttons
