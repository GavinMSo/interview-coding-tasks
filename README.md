# interview-coding-tasks
Homework problems to demonstrate a developer's ability to write code.

The goal of having language-specific boilerplate is to reduce the amount of yak-shaving required to work on a problem. Most projects aren't greenfield, code tests shouldn't be either.

This is MIT-licensed, we encourage pull requests to add problems or correct boilerplate.
